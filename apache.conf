#note that in order to keep the localhost default page at /var/www it was necessary to
#sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf /etc/apache2/conf-enabled/000-default.conf
#because 000-default.conf was sym-linked into /etc/apache2/sites-enabled and so wasn't evaluated correctly
#that is, this Vhost was the default
