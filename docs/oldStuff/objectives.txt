There already exists a beginning framework for a web based administration system for the SR2S applications.  But it occurred to me that we should take a bit more formalized approach to its development rather than the off-the-cuff stuff I have been doing.  Therefore, I present to you this statement/list of objectives.  Please alter or edit as you see fit until we come to consensus.

BTW, the term 'program' refers to the totality of the SR2S applications while 'system' refers to the computer code and the mechanisms for its implementation.  Thus, we are creating a system to administer the program and, when finished creating, we will have the ongoing task of administering the system which administers the program, see?

And, as promised, the objectives:

1. Use a web based approach to administering the data that comprise the SR2S program applications.  Right now, we have the timesheets, the infrastructure safety isses, and the mode surveys.

2. Secure this data using user logins and industry best practices.

3. Control user permissions on what any one user can see and what they can do.

4. Create mechanisms to download selected data in useable formats, eg. comma delimited files for loading to a spreadsheet.

5. Make the system easily cloneable into other instances for use by other SR2S organizations across the country (and the world? language issues...).

6. Allow for extending the system, ie. adding other applications.

7. Allow an instance of the system to be shareable by distinct agencies.

8. Create printer friendly versions of displayed data.

9. Development to be done in a collaborative manner using open source tools.
